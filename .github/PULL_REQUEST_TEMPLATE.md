## Summary

Short description of the change and why it is needed.

## Checklist
- [ ] I added or updated unit tests where appropriate (see `tests/`)
- [ ] I updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` if developer-facing behavior changed
- [ ] If data schemas changed (csv headers or column order) I added a migration script and updated `README.md`
- [ ] I ran `python -m pytest -q` locally and all tests passed
- [ ] I installed dev dependencies: `python -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt` (or in CI)

## Notes
- Small, behavior-preserving refactors are preferred. If schema or ID strategy is changed, provide a migration plan and sample fixture data to exercise it.
